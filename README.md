## Overview
Cute Avatar Sketch is a public REST API for generating cute sketch-style avatars based on your preferences or randomly. The idea for this API came from video game character creators. Before building the API, I used Procreate to draw various facial expressions, hairstyles, expressions, and accessories options for the avatars and generated avatar images with all the combinations with Python scripts. The API was then built with Next.js, a react framework that enables server-side rendering. Next.js also supports API routing, so I could write both front-end and back-end code within the same code base. On the website, users can choose between light and dark modes based on their preferences. They can also find documentation to learn how to use the API endpoints, and the avatar maker to preview avatars with all the available options.
